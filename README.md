The pandemic has taken the whole world by storm. But now we have to fight against it. We have come up with a mobile application that can make a huge impact and can change the tide of this battle against covid 19.

## This project tackles 2 major problems

1.  Lack of social distancing during and post pandemic
2.  Data tampering, because of political agendas  

## Features  

1.  The app works by getting the location of all users in a certain area and then comparing the density of people with a said threshold and informs the user whether the place is safe. This feature will help people plan their errands to different places while safely maintaining social distancing.
    
2.  It has a separate tab for public transport which tracks the location of people in a bus and let's the user know if it is safe to board the bus by comparing the density of people in it. This feature will help in restarting the public transport infrastructure post pandemic.
An important point to take note of is that the bus will not let any new passenger enter if the density is too high, which will help in following social distancing for the safety of everyone on board.

3.  A Blockchain based patient management system which improves transparency and robustness of the data as only the admins and Registered Hospitals can “add” to the data and their ethereum addresses get recorded to the main chain everytime they add a patient. The system is immutable, that is, it can only be added to (by registered Hospital addresses) and tampering with the old data is practically impossible!
    
## Advantages

1.  Can be implemented on the pre-existing infrastructure
    
2.  Zero/very low cost of implementation
    
3.  Time required to get it up and running is low because the easy distribution
    
4.  Bringing transparency and credibility in the data about the number of positive cases and death cases in the ongoing pandemic.
    
5. Increase the trust of the public on the pandemic data and government which should ultimately lead to more cooperation.
    
6.  Save the government a lot of money as there is no need for middlemen to handle the data or Verification agencies to verify the data. Everything will be done by the Smart Contract!

7.  In the current situation, the data might get corrupted or tampered with as there are so many people handling it. It also reduces accountability. Our App will prevent this from happening as nobody except the Hospitals will touch the input data.
    
8.  In the use of private servers, if something happens to the servers like the server goes down or gets destroyed, the data simply becomes either inaccessible or lost!. When kept on Ethereum blockchain or IPFS (a similar but cheaper technology) it is stored on nearly 10,000 nodes all around the world. You’ll need to destroy all the 10,000 nodes to actually be able to make data inaccessible.
